                                        <p class="p2">There are a couple ways to tell if your car needs a tire alignment. If you've noticed one or more of these indicators, you should have your alignment checked by a licensed service technician immediately.

                                        <h4>Fluid Exchanges</h4>
                                        <p class="p2">Your vehicle depends on essential fluids, such as transmission, brake, and power-steering fluids, to clean, cool, and lubricate. Over time, these fluids naturally lose their ability to flow freely, and this could cause serious problems such as transmission overheating and/or failure.

Regularly checking and topping off your car’s fluid levels may have many benefits, including:<br/>

Keeping your vehicle at peak performance<br/>
Protecting your transmission<br/>
Improving fuel efficiency</p>

                                                <p class="p3">Toyota marketed the Avalon as a replacement for the Toyota Cressida, a model discontinued for the American market in 1992. While the Cressida was an upper-level midsize rear-wheel-drive car with a straight-six engine, the Avalon is front-wheel-drive, powered by a V6 engine. In recent years, there has been considerable overlapping with its platform mates, the Toyota Camry V6 and the Lexus ES, although the third-generation Avalon was distinguished by offering extra legroom.For its fourth generation, the Avalon was introduced on a platform that is shared with the Lexus ES.</p>
                                                <h6><a class="link color-1" href="#">Toyota Venza</a></h6>
                                                <p class="img-indent-bot">US models had starting price of $25,975 for a front-wheel-drive (FWD) 4-cylinder model, ranging to $29,250 for the all-wheel-drive (AWD) V6 edition without options.</p>
                                                <h6><a class="link color-1" href="#">Honda CRV</a></h6>
                                                <p class="img-indent-bot">The Honda CR-V is a compact crossover, four-door sport utility vehicle (SUV) manufactured since 1995 by Honda. It uses the Honda Civic platform. According to the automaker's Japanese press information, "CR-V" stands for "Comfortable Runabout Vehicle"[1] while sales literature in the UK has made references to it as "Compact Recreational Vehicle" while some think it stands for "Civic Recreational Vehicle".</p>
                                                <h6><a class="link color-1" href="#">Honda Odyssey</a></h6>
                                                The Odyssey had originally been conceived and engineered in Japan, in the wake of the country's economic crisis of the 1990s – which in turn imposed severe constraints on the vehicle's size and overall concept, dictating the minivan's manufacture in an existing facility with minimal modification.[1] The result was a smaller minivan, in the Compact MPV class, that was well received in the Japanese domestic market[1] and less well received in North America.[2] The first generation Odyssey was marketed in Europe as the Shuttle.
